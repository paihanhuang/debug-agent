This indicates that the DDR activity is demanding higher power, thus increasing the VCORE level.\n\n- **CM causing VCORE increase**: The SW_REQ2 activity in DDR voting suggests that the Configuration Manager is actively involved in power management decisions, which is causing the VCORE level to rise. This is consistent with the high VCORE 725mV usage observed.\n\n- **MMDVFS ruled out**: Since MMDVFS is at OPP4, it is operating normally and is not contributing to the VCORE floor issue.

This aligns with the causal chain where DDR activity can lead to increased power consumption and VCORE levels.\n\n3. **MMDVFS Status:**\n   - MMDVFS is at OPP4, which is normal operation.
